The files here test oneapi support in spack. It installs compilers,
and uses icpc/icpx/ifort/ifx/g++/gfortran to build programs that use
the oneapi libraries and SYCL. It uses a sample package that contains
programs that use oneAPI components.

It tests the following:

* intel-oneapi-* packages as dependencies
* include directories are accessible
* library directories are accessible
* packages provide correct configuration when used as a virtual
  provider
* environment variables are set

Install prerequisites for testing::

  pip install -r requirements.txt

Setup tests::

  # Install and activate spack
  git clone https://github.com/spack/spack.git
  source spack/share/spack/setup-env.sh
  # Add the test packages
  spack repo add ./repo
  # Install and activate compilers
  spack install intel-oneapi-compilers
  spack compiler add `spack location -i intel-oneapi-compilers`/compiler/latest/linux/bin/intel64
  spack compiler add `spack location -i intel-oneapi-compilers`/compiler/latest/linux/bin

Run all tests::

  pytest -s tests

Run pre-commit checks::

  pre-commit run --all

The sample applications are in the samples_ directory. The spack
package that downloads/builds/installs the sample applications is in
the repo_ directory.

Adding samples
==============

Add to samples_, `package.py`_, and `test_packages.py`_.

Adding to CI
============

We divided the tests into groups because GitHub Actions runners do not
have enough disk space to install all of oneAPI.
